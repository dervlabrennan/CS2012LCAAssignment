# CS3012LCAAssignment

Assignment for Software Engineering CS3012:

The code for implementation of LCA (using a BT and a DAG) can be found in LCA.java and the code for the test classes can be found in LCATest.java.

The DAG branch was used to implement the enhanced challenge and has been merged to the master.

Both DAG.java and DAGTest.java can be disregarded as they have since been placed inside LCA.java and LCATest.java respectively.
